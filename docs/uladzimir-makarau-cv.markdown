# Uladzimir Makarau CV

## General

I'm a software developer with 7+ years of experience. 
I've been working mostly with .NET stack but also have written some code in Python, JavaScript, Rust and Haskell. Worked on different positions from junior to tech leader in various stages of software lifecycle starting from requirements gathering and high-level design to implementation and production support and maintenance.

In general, I like to solve problems with simple solutions and approaches. Interested in combining functional and object-oriented practices to write robust, simple and clean code.

## Experience

For 3 years I was working as a software developer in a trading company developing products for internal use only. 

Technology stack is mostly .NET apps ans services and SQL Server databases undeneath, but I also got some experience in Python. Few more details about projects I worked on:


1. A set of APIs and libraries for trading applications developers. These libraries exposed a unified domain model and set of services and hid the complexity of various underlying data sources with different protocols which could send thousands of updates per second.
2. A system that unified and normalized the process of valuating different types of financial securities for the purpose of end of day analysis. Was heavily involved in analysis of requirements and business domain space.
