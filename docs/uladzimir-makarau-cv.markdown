## General

I'm a full-stack software developer with 10+ years of experience. Programming for money since 2010.

I started with .NET stack, but a few years back almost completely switched to JavaScript/TypeScript (NodeJs, React). Proficient with Docker, Helm and Kubernetes.

Over the years, I tried several other languages like Python, Rust, Clojure and Haskell
Worked in various positions from junior to tech or team leader in miscellanious stages of software lifecycle from requirements gathering and high-level design to implementation and production support and maintenance.

In general, I like solving problems with simple solutions and approaches. Keen on combining functional and object-oriented practices in order to write a robust and clean code. Open to trying new platforms, technologies, languages and approaches.

## Experience

#### Targetprocess

*Minsk, Belarus. May 2017 - Current.*

I've been working as developer and team leader on improving [Targetprocess](https://www.targetprocess.com/) product. 
Mostly developed microservices and micro-frontends with occasional contributions to the .NET monolith. Was responsible for design, development and delivery of several subsystems such as:
1. Capacity planning tool with planning scenarios support. It allows to plan work across multiple teams or departments, ensure there's enough capacity to fit what's planned and predict when work is going to be completed.
2. Solutions Library/Marketplace - a tool which allows to install pre-configured solutios (e.g. WJSF prioritization or OKR management) into customer Targetprocess system

Technology stack: NodeJS + JavaScript/TypeScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, React, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm

#### Optiver

*Amsterdam, Netherlands. April 2014 - March 2017.*

For 3 years I was working as a software developer in a trading company developing products for internal use only. 

Technology stack was mostly .NET apps and services on Windows with SQL Server databases underneath, but I had also got some experience with Unix and Python. Few more details about projects I worked on:

1. A set of APIs and libraries for developers of trading applications. These libraries exposed a unified domain model and set of services and hid the complexity of various underlying data sources with different protocols which could send thousands of updates per second.
2. A system which unified and normalized the process of valuating different types of financial securities for the purpose of end-of-day analysis. Was heavily and actively involved in analysis of requirements and business domain space as well as tecnhical design and implementation.

I also took part in interviewing candidates, conducted interview sessions related to system design.

#### EPAM Systems

*Minsk, Belarus. Feb 2010 - March 2014.*

Various positions from junior to lead engineer on multiple outsourcing projects including maintenance of existing systems and developing of the new projects from scratch. Mostly web: ASP.NET MVC, Silverlight, JavaScript. Got some experience with TypeScript and Angular.

#### Other

Some of my projects:
1. [Memo List](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/memo-list/9wzdncrdclsb) - Windows Store client for to-do service Remember The Milk. Written in C#/XAML/F#
2. [Math Quest](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/math-quest/9wzdncrdclsc) - Windows Store math game. Written in C#/XAML
3. [Froto.TypeProvider](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Froto.TypeProvider/) - F# Type Provider for Google Protocol Buffers.

Over the course of past years I also worked on a few small pet projects mostly focused on getting some experience with new or previously not used technologies.
