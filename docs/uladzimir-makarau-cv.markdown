## General

I'm a software developer with 7+ years of experience. 
I've been working mostly with .NET stack but also have written some code in Python, JavaScript, Rust and Haskell. Worked on different positions from junior to tech leader in various stages of software lifecycle starting from requirements gathering and high-level design to implementation and production support and maintenance.

In general, I like solving problems with simple solutions and approaches. Interested in combining functional and object-oriented practices to write a robust, simple and clean code. Even though my experience is mostly .NET-based, I'm fine with leaving my comfort zone and exploring and trying new platforms, technologies and approaches.

## Experience

#### Optiver

*Amsterdam, Netherlands. April 2014 - March 2017.*

For 3 years I was working as a software developer in a trading company developing products for internal use only. 

Technology stack is mostly .NET apps ans services on Windows with SQL Server databases underneath, but I have also got some experience in Unix and Python. Few more details about projects I worked on:

1. A set of APIs and libraries for trading applications developers. These libraries exposed a unified domain model and set of services and hid the complexity of various underlying data sources with different protocols which could send thousands of updates per second.
2. A system which unified and normalized the process of valuating different types of financial securities for the purpose of end-of-day analysis. Was heavily and actively involved in analysis of requirements and business domain space as well as tecnhical design and implementation.

#### EPAM Systems

*Minsk, Belarus. Feb 2010 - March 2014.*

Various positions from junior to lead engineer on multiple outsourcing projects including maintenance of existing systems and developing of the new projects from scratch. Mostly web: ASP.NET MVC, Silverlight, JavaScript. Got some experience with TypeScript and Angular.

#### Other

Some of my projects:
1. [Memo List](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/memo-list/9wzdncrdclsb) - Windows Store client for to-do service Remember The Milk. Written in C#/XAML/F#
2. [Math Quest](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/math-quest/9wzdncrdclsc) - Windows Store math game. Written in C#/XAML
3. [Froto.TypeProvider](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Froto.TypeProvider/) - F# Type Provider for Google Protocol Buffers.

Over the course of past years I also worked on a few small pet projects mostly focused on getting some experience with new or previously not used technologies (lately: Node JS, React, Azure and Haskell)
